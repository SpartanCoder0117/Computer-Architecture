@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\mike_\desktop\5to semestre\arquitectura de computadoras\practicas de entrenamiento\generic00\div00.vhdl":20:4:20:5|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including G00.D01.sdiv[23:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
