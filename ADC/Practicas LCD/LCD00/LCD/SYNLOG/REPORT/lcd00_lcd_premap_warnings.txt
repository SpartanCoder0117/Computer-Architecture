@W: BN132 :"f:\lcd00\lcdcontdata00.vhdl":25:4:25:5|Removing sequential instance L03.outFlagcd because it is equivalent to instance L03.ENcd. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"f:\lcd00\div00.vhdl":20:0:20:1|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including L00.OS01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
